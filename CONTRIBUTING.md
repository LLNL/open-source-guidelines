## Welcome!

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory open source project! If you’re unsure about anything, just ask — or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we’ll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its LICENSE and its [README](https://github.com/llnl/open-source-guidelines/blob/master/README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [LLNL Open Source Guidelines GitHub repository]( https://github.com/LLNL/open-source-guidelines), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:github-admin@llnl.gov).
